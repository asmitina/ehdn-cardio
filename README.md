Tandem repeat expansions in cardiomyopathy

This directory contains the code for downstream analysis of rare tandem repet expansions in patients with cardiomyopathy.

Prior to the steps described here, I use ExpansionHunterDenovo on WGS data, ExpansionHunterDenovo scripts to combine the output, and tandem-repeat-expansions-in-ASD to define rare expansion outliers. 

I provide scripts to perform the genic burden test, calculate the distance to transcriptional start sites (TSSs) and calculate overlap with promoter and epigenetic marks for TSS-proximal repeat regions.
